## Adding a new distributor
- Find a png image of the logo with transparent or white background
- Resize the logo to a simmilar height / with to the others on the website and crop away any unneccesary whitespace around it
- Rename the logo to use lowercase letters, underscores or hyphens only.
- Upload the the logo to `assets/img/distributors/`
- Add an entry in the `_data/distributors.yml` file. Assuming your logos name is `travelstart.png` you'll add an entry like such,
using spaces for indentation where applicable:
```
- name: Travelstart
  logo: assets/img/distributors/travelstart.png
```
